# Create presentation

## How it all works
Presentations in Immersinity are made up of slides. Modules, such as text or equation, are placed in order on each slide. By the way, if you have an idea for a module, email us to [email](support@immersinity.com).

## How to edit presentation's contents?
Editing of presentations takes place in the constructor. To go to the constructor click on the button [icon](create) next to the desired presentation in the storage.

The constructor consists of three parts:
1) Slide List
2) Work area, showing the selected slide
3) List of modules

## Modules
Immersinity currently has 4 modules (more coming soon):

### Text
Corresponds to icon [icon](format_align_left). In addition to displaying text, this module has several additional features:

If you put one or more hash signes at the beginning of a line, this line will be displayed as a heading.

Also, an assistant for creating lists is built into the text module. Try to start typing any list and new items will be added automatically. Currently supported lists denoted by symbols '*', '+', '-' and numbered '1)', '1.'

### Image
Corresponds to icon [icon](insert_photo). This module displays the images you have uploaded. If you upload several images at once, Immersinity will automatically add as many image modules as you need to display all files you uploaded.

### Equation
Corresponds to icon [icon](functions). This module displays text in LaTeX format, which is usually used to write various equations. You can write LaTeX yourself, use any editor or go to the recommended one by clicking on the "Open editor" button in the module.

### Video
Corresponds to icon [icon](smart_display). This module displays YouTube videos. You just need to insert a link to the desired video in its only text field.
