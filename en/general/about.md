# What is Immersinity?
Immersity is a platform that allows you to create online presentations, which are shown directly in audience phones. Because of this, you can use Immersity any place and any time - even without a projector or on the go.

You can start using Immersinity without a manual, but if you need one, it's available [link](here)(https://immersinity.com/help#general-quick_guide).

If you enjoy using Immersinity, you can help us. We will be very glad if you recommend us to your friends or colleagues. You can also support the project by proposing a feature. To do this, reach us via email [email](support@immersinity.com).
