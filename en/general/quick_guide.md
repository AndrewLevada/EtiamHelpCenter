# Getting Started
There are two stages of using Immersinity: first, you create a presentation, and then manage its demonstration.

## Creating presentation
To create a presentation, click on the largest button in [link](storage)(https://immersinity.com/dashboard/) with the corresponding text ("Add presentation") on it. In the window that appears, enter the name of the presentation (you can change it anytime later) and click the "Create" button. You will be taken to the constructor - the place where you fill your presentation with content.

Each presentation consists of slides, and each slide consists of sequentially placed modules. Come up with a title for your first slide, and then add one of the modules to it, for example text, by clicking on the icon corresponding to the module [icon](format_align_left). Text field will immediately be displayed in the work area, and you will be able to type text in it.

At the moment, only basic modules are implemented. You can familiarize yourself with their full description [link](here)(https://immersinity.com/help#processes-create).

## Showing presentation
This way you fill your presentation with content. When everything is ready, go back to the presentation storage, and click button [icon](slideshow) to control demonstration of the presentation.
